# Pathfinding-on-a-2D-Grid
Amazon's Coding Exercise for Bright Network

A website to implement: https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/



#### Reflection:
1. start writing the code without doing any research
2. have solved the problem but only with the small grid and still need to improve the method
3. haven't use the search method, e.g. best first search, etc.
4. still need to write a new file to implement using search method
